# AI-Powered Water Usage Awareness and Conservation Assistant

## SDG Alignment
- SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation
- SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

## Problem Statement
Water wastage is a critical sustainability issue caused by lack of awareness and feedback on daily consumption patterns. This project addresses the need for accessible, AI-driven guidance to promote responsible water usage.

## Solution Overview
This project presents a conversational AI assistant that provides insights, recommendations, and awareness regarding water consumption using prompt-based AI workflows.

## AI Technologies Used
- Prompt Engineering
- Conversational AI
- Information Summarization
- Conceptual use of IBM Granite models

## Project Status
Conceptual prototype with documented workflows and prompts.

## AI Workflow (Prototype)

1. User provides basic water usage details or asks a question related to daily water consumption.
2. The AI assistant processes the input using a predefined prompt focused on sustainability and water conservation.
3. The system compares the input with sustainable water usage benchmarks.
4. The AI generates clear insights, awareness messages, and practical water-saving recommendations.
5. The user uses these insights to make informed decisions about reducing water wastage.
